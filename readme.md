# Titanic Survival Exploration with Decision Trees
In this lab, you will see how decision trees work by implementing a decision tree in sklearn.  
Do some data preprocessing. First, we'll one-hot encode the features.  
Train a model in sklearn. First, let's split the data into training and testing sets. Then train the model on the training set.  
calculate the accuracy over both the training and the testing set.  
Train a new model, and try to specify some parameters in order to improve the testing accuracy, such as:  
  max_depth  
  min_samples_leaf  
  min_samples_split  
feel free to use Grid Search! Try to get to 85% accuracy on the testing set.
